# modelling_pbsa_rents
A Project Using Machine Learning Tools to Model PBSA Rents in the UK

In this project, we explore data containing the rental rates achieved by Purpose-Built Student Accommodation ("PBSA") assets in the UK to see if we can predict the rental rates achieved, given a set of features. 

We start by importing and cleaning the data before performing some Exploratory Data Analysis ("EDA") to better understand our dataset.

Following the EDA, we prove that we can apply a linear model to the data and then engineer the features to be ready for modelling.

We then explore three different modelling approaches, namely, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, before iterating a selected model.

Once we have a final model, we evaluate it within the wider context of the UK PBSA market.
